### **Functional Tasks**

#### Backend (API)

* [x] POST `/upload` ‚Äì Handle file upload, parse Excel, validate and save to DB
* [x] POST `/search` ‚Äì Accept account number and return record details
* [x] POST `/update-transfer` ‚Äì Update transfer number and active status
* [x] GET `/download-log?fileName={name}` ‚Äì Download error log file for failed rows

#### Frontend (UI - React/Angular/Vue)

* [x] Add new tab: **Exception Account Manager**
* [x] File upload section with validation (accept `.xlsx`, 14-digit check)
* [x] Display upload success/failure results with log file download link
* [x] Search bar to enter and search account number
* [x] Display search result in editable form
* [x] Enable inline update of `Transfer Number` and `Is Active`
* [x] Show loader, success, and error messages
* [x] Prevent update if validations fail

---

### **Validation Rules**

* Account Number: Exactly 14 digits
* Transfer Number: 10‚Äì12 digits (customizable)
* Is Active: Accepts only `Y` or `N`
* App Name: Defaulted to `"RA"` unless explicitly overridden

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

* Upload must support up to 30,000 rows
* Must return response within 10 seconds
* Audit updates with timestamps and userId

---

### **Dependencies**

* Excel template specification (column headers, formats)
* DB table: `OVERRIDE_TRANSFER_NUMBER_FOR_EXCEPTION_ACCOUNT`
* Logging and audit implementation
* Spring Boot backend services
* Frontend integration (React preferred)

---

Certainly! Here's a **professional and clear JIRA story description** tailored as a **business requirement** for your `PHOadminPortal` application:

### üìù JIRA Story Description

---

**Title:** Implement Exception Account Management UI Tab for Transfer Number Handling

**Description:**

The business has identified the need to manage a specific set of customer accounts known as **exception accounts**, which require manual handling of transfer numbers. These accounts will be maintained through a new UI tab in the **PHOadminPortal**.

The objective is to enable administrators to:

* Upload bulk exception account numbers (14-digit format) using an Excel file.
* Validate and store only clean, compliant records in the database.
* Search for specific accounts and view their current transfer number and status.
* Edit the `Transfer Number` and `Is Active` fields for these accounts through the UI.
* Download error logs for any failed uploads or invalid rows.

This functionality is being developed to address operational needs where automatic mapping does not apply and manual oversight of these accounts is necessary.

---

### üíº Business Rationale:

Currently, exception accounts and their transfer numbers are managed manually via scripts or DB changes, which increases the risk of error, lacks traceability, and slows down operations.

By building this UI:

* **Efficiency** improves through self-service management of exception accounts.
* **Accuracy** increases with validations in place to restrict bad data.
* **Auditability** is enhanced by recording all changes with user IDs and timestamps.
* **Scalability** is enabled by supporting uploads of large files (e.g., up to 30,000 accounts).

This tab will serve as a centralized and secure portal for handling exception routing logic across various internal teams.
