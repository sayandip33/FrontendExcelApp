I would like to inform you that, due to unforeseen personal reasons, I will be on leave from 9th to 13th June 2025. I sincerely apologize for the short notice and any inconvenience this may cause.

In my absence, Ritesh will be taking care of my responsibilities to ensure continuity of work. If required, I will make myself available for the status call; otherwise, Ritesh will attend on my behalf.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
